- 👋 Hi, I’m @DukeJFP
- ✔ and my real name is Duke
- 👀 I’m interested in finding fellow students, doing the course Software Tester, by GetCertified in Arnhem, the Netherlands...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Software Tester (automated testing in a DevOps concept)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... Nice question, but I'm a real beginner, even in IT as a whole, so I do not know. I will start learning and then find out. I hope....
- 📫 How to reach me ... Will fill this in later.
- 📖 Living near Rotterdam, being 55 and finally found out what I want to be when (if?) I grow to be an adult.
